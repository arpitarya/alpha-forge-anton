"""Process-wide registry of broker sources.

Holds one BrokerSource instance per slug. State (cached holdings + last
sync timestamp) is in-memory; persistence to disk/DB is a layer above.

Each slug has a single primary source — preferring API where free, falling
back to CSV upload (the new API sources also implement `parse()` so the
`/sources/{slug}/upload` endpoint still works as a manual fallback).
